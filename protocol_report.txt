Protocol Analysis Report - Wireshark Capture

Captured Duration: ~1 minute
Capture Tool: Wireshark

Identified Protocols:
----------------------
1. **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
   - Used for resolving domain names to IP addresses.
   - Observed packets: DNS query to "google.com".

2. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
   - Provides reliable data transmission.
   - Observed as part of web browsing (HTTP/TLS connections).

3. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**  
   - Protocol for web communication.
   - Observed GET/POST requests during website visits.

Optional (if seen):
4. **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**  
   - Used for encrypted communication (HTTPS).
   - Packets observed but not readable due to encryption.

Packet Examples:
----------------
- DNS Query: A request to resolve "www.google.com".
- TCP Handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK sequence observed.
- HTTP GET Request: Accessed "http://example.com" with a visible GET request.

Conclusion:
-----------
This exercise helped in understanding live network traffic, analyzing common protocols, and using filters like `dns`, `tcp`, `http` in Wireshark.
