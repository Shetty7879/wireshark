# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis ðŸš€

## ðŸ“Œ Task
Capture live network traffic using Wireshark and identify at least 3 different network protocols.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Learn how to use Wireshark for packet capture.
- Understand network traffic and protocol analysis.
- Practice filtering and analyzing packets.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Wireshark (free tool)

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `capture.pcap` â€“ The captured network traffic
- `protocol_report.txt` â€“ Report on identified protocols
- `screenshots/` â€“ (Optional) Screenshots of Wireshark and filters
- `README.md` â€“ This documentation

## ðŸ“‘ Identified Protocols
1. DNS
2. TCP
3. HTTP

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- Packet filtering using protocol names (e.g., `http`, `tcp.port == 80`)
- How a DNS query and HTTP GET request looks
- Basics of the TCP 3-way handshake

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots
*(Include if required, place in the `screenshots/` folder)*
